# Giant overengineed clusterfuck. The most blatant I have ever done and probably will ever do. Template wizardry, obscure constexpr at my finest level. Features a custom shading language and a render pass one. Even includes a C++17 generator. That's right, you can generate C++ from C++. Boom. You've been warned.
